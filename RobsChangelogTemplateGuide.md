# Changelog Template Guide - Rob's sections

## What is a Changelog and who creates it?

A Changelog is a comprehensive, reverse-chronological list of changes to a software or a technology project, written by developers or engineering team members, from its inception to the current state. It displays all project changes, when they were made, by whom, and why. An entry is made to the Changelog when there is a change to the software. Changes can range from additions, deletions, and other significant changes to project code, such as new features, bug fixes, database changes, UX changes, etc. changelogs are also an important historical record when fixing bugs or making other software efficiencies since it shows the changes the software has gone through and can show where something went wrong or the inefficiency happened or when the change was made.

Although geared more towards developers and engineers, there is a certain percentage of power users who keenly read about all new changes to the software, a new feature they were looking forwqrd to, or any bug fixes they had reported.

The difference between release notes and changelogs is that release notes inform product or software users of any recent or new changes, new or feature enhancements, or bug fixes and therefore are more user/customer-centric. Release notes also focus on how these improvements help the customers improve their performance and work and increase their experience using our software or product. Release notes provide updated information to previously distributed user documentation and play an essential role in customer experience and communication and have the potential to increase user and customer loyalty. Product managers or the marketing department generally write release notes to communicate with the customers and build a long-term relationship by focusing on a customer-centric approach to product development.

Currently, there is no standard changelog format, however, there are open-source engineers and other technology folks who have suggested similar formats to follow for a changelog. these formats follow and use a consistent style of headings, documenting changes, and using specific tags for specific change. 

There is no standardized Changelog format; however, there is “good practice” advice and recommendations from experienced software engineers and other industry experts on how to standardize and format a changelog within the project and then to consistently use that standard nd format. Semantic Versioning and ISO date standard is recommended.

## Why should we create a Changelog OR What are the benefits of a Changelog?

Creating a changelog, and consistently maintaining it for subsequent code releases for an open-source project is recommended and considered good practice for a number of reasons:

- A changelog file gives product users a good window into project governance, and a well formatted, consistent, and informative changelog gives users a feeling of confidence using the product or the software as it shows them the software/product company is committed to consistently make improvements to the product and keep the impact of any change to the product on the users. This in turn makes the users feel comfortable and generates loyalty to the product. Customer loyalty and satisfaction has a huge impact of any software company.

- Along with additions, deletions, new features, and bug fixes, a changelog also shows deprecations when upgrading, or security changes to the software to address software vulnerabilities.
  
- Changelogs helps in bug fixing allowing developers and engineers to retrace the codebase updates and zero in on where changes occurred, why they occurred, and what is causing the bug, and how to fix it.

- Changelogs help in identifying conceptual inconsistencies in software as a whole, or in specific code modules, by analyzing project history and determining how the conflicting concepts were implemented and what were the specific changes.

## Who can benefit from a Changelog?

- Changelogs helps developers stay informed and up-to-date of overall project changes, helps migration efforts, and gives individual developers to show their skills.

- A Changelog offers valuable and actionable metrics and insight into the software product by collecting bugs-to-feature ratio. This information can be used to plan and create a future product road map, such as concentrating on developing bug-free code.

- Changelogs keep product users in the loop, and engaged and excited about new software changes and updates and boosts their morale that results in customer loyalty. Product power-users sometime can influence product choices based on their experience with the product.
  
- Changelogs help other developers and team members learn and understand your work. They also help in re-learning and understanding code logic, as well as on boarding new develops to the project.

- Changelogs are not very difficult to maintain even if done manually once developers get into the habit of documenting software changes. There are tools and applications that can automate Changelogs and convert them into human-readable formats.
