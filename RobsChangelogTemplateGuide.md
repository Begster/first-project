# Changelog Template Guide - Rob's sections

## What is a Changelog and who creates it?

A Changelog is a reverse-chronological list of changes to a software or a technology project, written by developers or engineering team members, from its inception to the current state. It displays all project changes when they were made, by whom, and why. An entry is made to the Changelog when there is a change to the software. These changes include additions, deletions, and other significant changes to project code, such as new features, bug fixes, database changes, UX changes, etc. changelogs are also an important historical record when fixing bugs or making other software efficiencies since it shows the changes the software has gone through and can show where something went wrong or the inefficiency happened or when the change was made.

Although geared more towards developers and engineers, power users are also a group who review changelogs keenly.

The difference between release notes and changelogs is that release notes inform product or software users of any recent or new changes, new or feature enhancements, or bug fixes and therefore are more user/customer-centric. Release notes also focus on how these improvements help the customers improve their performance and work and increase their experience using our software or product. Release notes provide updated information to previously distributed user documentation and play an essential role in customer experience and communication and have the potential to increase user and customer loyalty. Product managers or the marketing department generally write release notes to communicate with the customers and build a long-term relationship by focusing on a customer-centric approach to product development.

**`[TODO: who creates a changelog?]`**

- developers and other engineering team members


**`[TODO: short blurb about Changelog format??]`**
There is no standardized Changelog format; however, there is “good practice” advice and recommendations, especially for open-source projects, suggesting standardizing documenting structures based on organizational standards. Using Semantic Versioning and ISO date standards is highly recommended. **`[TODO: should we reference more details to follow in the below sections?]`**


## Why should we create one?

- creating and maintaining a changelog is considered a good practice
- a good window into project governance
- shows changes and deprecations for upgrades
- shows new features and bug fixes
- helps is bug research and fixing 
- can help with conceptual inconsistencies between different parts of a program "by giving you a history of how the conflicting concepts arose, who they came from, and why the conflicting changes were made” 
- helps developers stay up-to-date with software changes and helps migrating to new versions.(Keeps devlopers on teh same page by being aware of what was changed or fixed)
- offers valuable insights and metrics into project/product (such as bugs-to-feature ratio and for example adjust focus towards adding more features or based on the metrics, focus towards writing bug-free code) (helps in creating future project roadmap) (can get analytics on project activity)
- not very difficult to maintain, especially if automated. (there are some great tools to automate changelogs) 
- keeps users in the loop - for both oss projects and startups.(a boost to team morale when users are aware and excited about product changes)
- helps other developers and team members learn and understand your work
- helps is re-learning or with onboadring new developers to the codebase
