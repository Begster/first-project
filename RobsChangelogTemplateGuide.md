# Changelog Template Guide - Rob

Disclaimer: This Changelog Template Guide document and advice is limited to the Open Source Software (OSS) domain.

**TODO:** We should define who the audience for a changelog is? We have end-users, customers, and clients. End-users generally are users of the software product; however, I believe end-users are mainly developers in OSS. Since our initial intent is to create a changelog for the OSS domain, which term should we use in this doc? Or, should we make a disclaimer, in the beginning to indicate what we mean by an end-user, customers, and clients and maybe use one of these terms consistently?
End-users could be called: consumers, developers, etc.

## What is a changelog?

* [definition 1] Changelog is a reverse-chronological, comprehensive listing of notable and/or significant changes between consecutive versions of software or a technology project, from its inception to the current state.
* [definition 2] Changelog is a reverse-chronological, cumulative record of all significant and noteworthy changes to a software product.
* Changelogs show changes to the software: when they were made, by whom, and why. Each time a software change is made, an entry is added to the changelog thereby keeping a running log of project changes over time.
Changes can range from additions, deletions, and other significant updates to project code, such as new features, bug fixes, database changes, UX changes, and so forth.
* Changelogs are an important historical record when fixing bugs or making other software efficiencies. It shows the exact changes the software had gone through and where something went wrong, the inefficiency, or when the change was made.
* Generally geared towards developers and engineers, a certain percentage of power users eagerly read Changelogs when a new version is released for changes to the software, whether it is a new feature they were hoping for or a bug fix they reported.
* Changelog is an important file for open source software (OSS) projects as many people from different geographic areas in different time zones may be working on the project, and need to be aware of changes that have taken place or are in progress.
* Changelog history can show and help uncover and help remove conceptual inconsistencies between different parts of a software program.

*[POSSIBLE DELETE FROM HERE TO THE CLOSE BRACKET: Keeping a written record/log of the progression of changes and improvements a software application or product goes through helps developers, product managers, and customers stay informed of the progress and increases stakeholder trust and engagement. The terms Release Notes and Changelogs are sometimes used interchangeably to inform the reader of software changes to the codebase over time. However, nuanced differences between these two documents, and their two very different audiences, are worth noting. Both these documents offer an opportunity to build trust and loyalty between product users and the company by making consistent and continuous improvement to the product and sharing them with the users and stakeholders. They are also a good way for the company to acknowledge the contributions of its software developers and engineers by listing them by name on these documents which improves morale, and increase motivation and excitement for improving the software product.END OF POSSIBLE DELETE]*

## What are release notes?

* The terms Release Notes and Changelogs are sometimes used interchangeably to inform the reader of software changes to the codebase over time. However, nuanced differences between these two documents, and their two very different audiences, are worth noting.
* Although similar to changelogs in that they both describe software changes to existing products, the audience, messaging, and content are differently focused, written, and formatted.  
* Release Notes can also be viewed as updates to previously distributed user documentation. It focuses on:
Informing product end users of the changes and updates to the product.
* Highlighting how these changes and updates are beneficial to the end users and how it enriches and enhances their experience with the product.
* Using clear, plain, succinct, and jargon-free language proactively communicate with end users emphasizing empathy, open communication, companyâ€™s commitment to the product and continuous improvement, and promoting customer loyalty
putting the end users at ease by using appropriate humor and emojis.
* Release notes can have both internal and external end users.
* Its main message is to fill-in the gap between user documentation and new changes, and how these changes will improve user interaction with the software. inform users of the new software/product changes and how these changes would benefit the users in performing their daily work.
* The changes could be new features, feature enhancements, or bugs fixes, /issues identified by users, and other efficiencies that are user-centric.
* Release Notes are also a way product management and marketing can proactively reach out to customers to maintain or increase customer relations, build brand loyalty, and empower the customer.
* Besides being an effective tool to communicate with the user community, Release Notes also give the users a peek into the company's commitment to the growth of the product, as well as into the longevity and support of the product customers depend on.
* Clearly and succinctly articulated and well formatted, Release Notes are quite beneficial in aligning internal stakeholders and external customers towards the future growth of the product.

### Changelogs & Release Notes - similarities and differences?

* Changelogs and Release Notes are sometimes referred to interchangeably. They are both created when a new version of the product is released; however, they are quite different based on their content, intended audience, technical details, content formatting.
* [additional way to describe release notes] Release notes inform product or software users of recent or new changes, new features or feature enhancements, or bug fixes and therefore are more user-centric. Release notes also focus on how these improvements help the customers improve their performance, work, and user  experience using our software or product. Release notes provide updated information to previously distributed user documentation and play an essential role in customer experience and communication and have the potential to increase user and customer loyalty.

Here are similarities and differences between the two:

#### **Similarities**

They both:

* Describe and communicate specific product/software changes in a specific and linear format.
* Contain high-level information about product/software changes to involved parties.

#### **Differences**

Changelog:

* Primary audience is developers and engineering team.
* Content is technical and verbose.
* Written by developers or other engineering team members.
* Focus is on informing developers of specific software/product changes, who made it, why, and when.
* Helps in bug fixing, history shows product progression.
* Is meant to be a comprehensive historical document of all software changes to-date.
* A good way to recognize developers by name.

Release Notes:

* Primary audience are product users - internal or external.
* Content is succinct and concise.
* Written by product manager or marketing.
* Focus is on describing how new changes directly benefit the users, solves a problem they had, or improves their experience with the product.
* A marketing opportunity for client communication: show commitment to product, up-sell,  strengthen customer relations, increase product loyalty, showcase internal process improvements, show user empathy, etc.)

### Why do we need a Changelog?) / What are the benefits?

* [this appears to be true for both changelogs and release notes??] Keeping a change log of all noteworthy and important changes in the life cycle of a software product, helps developers, product managers, and customers stay informed of these changes and helps developers and technicians stay on top of incorporating these changes in their own business or personal apps.
* Up-to-date change logs are an excellent resource for bug fixing and helps developers quickly narrow the change which might have impacted the application section where the bug appears.
* Open source developers appreciate the consistent and up-to-date-ness of changelogs as it shows the level of commitment the open source company has.
* Changelogs can help developers find and remove conceptual inconsistencies in software based on the history of changes and why they were made.
* *[TODO: rephrase and refine]* They increase stakeholder (developer) trust and engagement. They offer an opportunity to build trust and loyalty between product users and the company by making consistent and continuous improvement to the product and sharing them with the users and stakeholders.
* *[TODO: rephrase and refine]* They are also a good way for the company to acknowledge the contributions of its software developers and engineers by listing them by name on these documents which improves morale, and increases motivation and excitement for improving the software product.
* OSS necessitates need for well-maintained changelogs even more so than proprietary or closed source software since users of OSS cannot depend on traditional help desks and have to troubleshoot with the OSS community or dig around for information.

### Who can benefit from a Changelog?

A changelog benefits both the developers and the OSS users.OSS developers and end user benefits:

* Open source projects that use changelogs provide a great benefit to developers who use open source software and libraries for both development and maintenance.
* Developers can see what changed in the current version of the project when compared to the previous version(s) in terms of additions, removals, bug fixes, deprecations, or changes relating to security among others.
* Without a well-maintained changelog, developers would have to look through various documents or different versions of the source code to understand what changed and why.
* Changelogs mention individual developers by name thus acknowledging their contributions to the project and increasing project buy-in and commitment.
* Developers can see software change history in one place consistently and don't have to dig through source code, code comments, commit messages, or other documentation to try and find what changed from previously released software and even then not being certain they have the correct answer.
* Same types of changes are grouped together with links to additional documentation.

### Who is resposible for writing the Changelog?

Changelogs are generally written by developers or software engineering team members, while Release notes are written by Product managers or the marketing department. generally write release notes to communicate with the customers and build long-term relationships by focusing on a customer-centric approach to product development.

### What is Changelog format?

Currently, there is no standard changelog format, however, developers and technology experts in the open source domain suggest Changelog formats to use. These suggestions use specific date and versioning formats, level of detail, information to include, and groupings of specific and similar changes.
The [Changelog Format section] in this document has specific and detailed advice.

### Why should we create a Changelog or What are the benefits of a Changelog?

Creating a changelog, and consistently maintaining it for subsequent code releases, for open source projects is highly recommended and considered good practice for a number of reasons:

*[TODO: this section needs to be rewritten to be changelog-specific]*

* A changelog file gives product users a good window into project governance, and a well formatted, consistent, and informative changelog gives users a feeling of confidence using the product or the software as it shows them the software/product company is committed to consistently make improvements to the product and keep the impact of any change to the product on the users. This in turn makes the users feel comfortable and generates loyalty to the product. Customer loyalty and satisfaction has a huge impact of any software company.
* Along with additions, deletions, new features, and bug fixes, a changelog also shows deprecations when upgrading, or security changes to the software to address software vulnerabilities.
* Changelogs helps in bug fixing allowing developers and engineers to retrace the codebase updates and zero in on where changes occurred, why they occurred, and what is causing the bug, and how to fix it.
* Changelogs help in identifying conceptual inconsistencies in software as a whole, or in specific code modules, by analyzing project history and determining how the conflicting concepts were implemented and what were the specific changes.
* Clearly written and consistently maintained project documentation, including Changelogs, is an essential factor in determining if developers will use an open source project or not. Using software with poorly maintained documentation is a large enough risk factor to pass on the software, no matter how good it might be.

## Who benefits from a Changelog?

* Changelogs helps developers stay informed and up-to-date of overall project changes, helps migration efforts, and gives individual developers to show their skills.

* A Changelog offers valuable and actionable metrics and insight into the software product by collecting bugs-to-feature ratio. This information can be used to plan and create a future product road map, such as concentrating on developing bug-free code.

* Changelogs keep product users in the loop, and engaged and excited about new software changes and updates and boosts their morale that results in customer loyalty. Product power-users sometime can influence product choices based on their experience with the product.
  
* Changelogs help other developers and team members learn and understand your work. They also help in re-learning and understanding code logic, as well as on boarding new develops to the project.

* Changelogs are not very difficult to maintain even if done manually once developers get into the habit of documenting software changes. There are tools and applications that can automate Changelogs and convert them into human-readable formats.
