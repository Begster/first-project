# What is a Changelog?

A Changelog is a reverse-chronological list of changes to a software or a technology project, from its inception to the current state. It shows all project changes, who made them, and why. An update is made to this file when there is a project change. These changes include additions, deletions, and software changes to project code, such as new features, bug fixes, database changes, UX changes, etc. 

Although related to Release Notes, a Changelog is different because it includes additional technical and detailed information, while Release Notes focus more on the customer- or user-centric project changes.

There is no standardized Changelog format; however, there is “good practice” advice and recommendations, especially for open-source projects, suggesting standardizing documenting structures based on organizational standards. Using Semantic Versioning and ISO date standards is highly recommended. [TODO - should we reference more details to follow in the below sections?]

Version 2
Changelogs are a window into the technical journey of a project, from its inception to its current state. It is a file that informs users of 1—current changes to project files, and 2. a running list of all project changes since inception. Changelogs are similar to Release Notes; however, the intent, message format, and detail level are geared more towards project developers and engineers. However, a spectrum of power users is also interested and keen to learn and understand the new changes.

Version 3
Generally, A changelog is a technical resource for the technical people on the project and some power users of a software product. In reverse chronological format, it contains all project changes for every software release from the project’s inception.
