# My First GitHub Project

I'm very excited to create my first GitHub project where I will practice Git, GitHub, and VSCode and house my first writing project with The Good Docs Project (TGDP).

## TGDP project

The project is to create a Changelog Template and a Changelog Template Guide in a pair-writing experiment with a seasoned tech writer and mentor!
