# My First GitHub Project

I'm very excited to create my first GitHub project where I will practice Git, GitHub, and VSCode and house my first writing project with The Good Docs Project!

## Project - Create Changelog Template & Changelog Template Guide

This project is to create a Changelog Template and a Changelog Template Guide in a pair-writing experiment with a seasoned tech writer and mentor!

I look forward to contributing to this project and, hopefully, not being a drag on the time and resources of my mentors, the Community Docs team, and the larger Good Docs Project community.
